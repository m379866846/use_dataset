# Dataset
The USE datasets consist of MultiWOZ and SGD, two popular datasets commonly used for task-oriented dialogue systems. Within the provided folders, four versions of these datasets are included. The original datasets, annotated by Sun et al. (2021), contain dialogue act labels for each dialogue turn as well as overall user satisfaction labels. We re-annotated the user satisfaction ratings using methods outlined in our paper.

The dataset versions are as follows:
- human_sgd: The SGD dataset with USE labels provided by our human annotators.
- gpt4o_sgd: The SGD dataset with USE labels generated by gpt-4.1.
- human_mwoz: The MultiWOZ dataset with USE labels provided by our human annotators.
- gemini_mwoz: The MultiWOZ dataset with USE labels generated by Gemini 2.5 Pro.


This dataset follows the format of the datasets published by the USDA (https://github.com/dengyang17/USDA).
