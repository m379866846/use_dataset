# Dataset
The USE datasets include MultiWOZ and SGD, two widely used datasets for task-oriented dialogue systems. 

This dataset has been relabeled using Claude 3.7 Sonnet for SGD, and Gemini 2.5 Pro for Mwoz with instructions proposed in the paper and follows the format of the datasets published by the USDA (https://github.com/dengyang17/USDA).
